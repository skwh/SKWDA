Some Kid With Dijkstra's Algorithm
==================================
An implementation of Dijkstra's Algoritm in JavaScript.

The example, `index.html`, uses several node maps. The first node map is based on [the animation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dijkstra_Animation.gif) on the Dijkstra's Algorithm [Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm), the other two I made up.
