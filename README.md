Some Kid With Dijkstra's Algorithm
==================================
An implementation of Dijkstra's Algoritm in JavaScript.

The example, `index.html`, uses several node maps. The first node map is based on [the animation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dijkstra_Animation.gif) on the Dijkstra's Algorithm [Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm), the other two I made up.

Soon this project will become mostly Objective-C, the implementation of DA will be used in an iPhone app.

I wrote a Java Implementation of this because I enjoy the class structure that Java brings, also as a warmup for writing it in Objective-C. In case you were wondering what jSKWDA is (java Some Kid With Dijkstra's Algorithm).
